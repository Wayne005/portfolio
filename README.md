## About me

Hello my name is Wayne Tay and I am from 6 Curie of Palm View Primary School. I am a dedicated student pursuing my passion for computer science and programming. I believe that programming as well as AI will soon shape the future for all our lives as a useful tool capable of shortening tedious task as well as providing precision that is needed to accomplish other tasks. I aspire to make an impact in the world overall by using computer science to help me on my journey. I was first inspired to start programming after I discovered a block-based game engine named "Scratch" when i was nine during a CCA trial for robotics even though i decided on basketball, I continued to pursue my intrest in computing and have moved on to Python in the middle of June 2022. When moving to Python, I realised how computer science and AI can help this world be a better place and aspired to pursue this passion of mine so that I can use this technology to help make the world a better place for everyone.

## School Management Project [Github Link](https://github.com/Wayne005/Student-Management-Project)

I made a project that reads CSV files and allows teachers to monitor students grades and see the average grade for each student, the average grade of all students in a course, the average grade of all courses for a student, the grades a student got and the AL or alphabet scoring converter.
