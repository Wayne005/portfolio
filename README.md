# Projects

1. School Management Project [Github Link](https://github.com/Wayne005/Student-Management-Project)

i made a project that reads CSV files and allows teachers to monitor studets grades and see the average grade for each student, the average grade of all students in a course, the average grade of all courses for a student, the grades a student got and the AL or alphabet scoring converter.

2. Kamen Rider OOO Belt [Scratch Link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/846486191/fullscreen/)

a simple scratch game that recognises patterns from the TV show. This game features the kamen rider belt that the character uses to transform for the game i used the models from someone else but the code itself is all mine so credits to [Dylandaray](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Dylandaray/) of scratch for providing the models so my game pops up when you click his link
