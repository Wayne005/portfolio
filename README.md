## About me

Hello my name is Wayne Tay and I am from 6 Curie of Palm View Primary School. I am a dedicated student pursuing my passion for computer science and programming. I believe that programming as well as AI will soon shape the future for all our lives as a useful tool capable of shortening tedious task as well as providing precision that is needed to accomplish other tasks. I aspire to make an impact in the world overall by using computer science to help me on my journey. I was first inspired to start programming after I discovered a block-based game engine named "Scratch" when i was nine during a CCA trial for robotics even though i decided on basketball, I continued to pursue my intrest in computing and have moved on to Python in the middle of June 2022. When moving to Python, I realised how computer science and AI can help this world be a better place and aspired to pursue this passion of mine so that I can use this technology to help make the world a better place for everyone.

# Achievements

## Python Hackathon
   The Hackathon focuses on overcoming challenges involving crucial programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, lists, functions, list comprehension, dictionaries, as well as search and sorting algorithms. Participants are challenged with leveraging these fundamental topics to devise innovative solutions and showcase their problem-solving skills effectively.

# Project

## School Management Project [Github Link](https://github.com/Wayne005/Student-Management-Project)

I made a project that reads CSV files and allows teachers to monitor students grades and see the average grade for each student, the average grade of all students in a course, the average grade of all courses for a student, the grades a student got and the AL or alphabet scoring converter.
