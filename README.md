## About me

Hello, my name is Wayne Tay, and I am from 6 Curie at Palm View Primary School. I am a dedicated student pursuing my passion for computer science and programming. I believe that programming and AI will soon shape the future of our lives, serving as invaluable tools to streamline tedious tasks and provide the precision needed to accomplish complex goals. I aspire to make a significant impact on the world by leveraging computer science in my journey.

My interest in programming began when I discovered a block-based game engine named “Scratch” at the age of nine during a CCA trial for robotics. Although I ultimately chose basketball, I continued to nurture my interest in computing and transitioned to Python in mid-June 2022. Through this experience, I realized how computer science and AI can contribute to making the world a better place. This realization has fueled my desire to pursue this passion and use technology to benefit everyone.

# Achievements

## Python Hackathon
   The Hackathon focuses on overcoming challenges involving crucial programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, lists, functions, list comprehension, dictionaries, as well as search and sorting algorithms. Participants are challenged with leveraging these fundamental topics to devise innovative solutions and showcase their problem-solving skills effectively.

# Project

## School Management Project [Github Link](https://github.com/Wayne005/Student-Management-Project)

I made a project that reads CSV files and allows teachers to monitor students grades and see the average grade for each student, the average grade of all students in a course, the average grade of all courses for a student, the grades a student got and the AL or alphabet scoring converter.
